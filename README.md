## Benefits
- Decoupling of publishers and subscribers (easy management & change)
- Scaling (N+1)
- Low Latency and high throughput
- Fault Tolerance
- Back-pressure handling
- Reliability
- provide Streaming & Batching

## Use-cases
- Asynchronous Messaging
- Realtime Stream Processing
- Logging & Monitoring
- Event Sourcing
- Realtime Analytics

## Components
- Publishers (Producers) push message to Kafka
- Consumers (Subscribers) listen and receive messages and provide offset management
- Broker (Kafka Cluster/Instance) receives messages and store replicated within the cluster. Broker handles all requests from clients (produce, consume, and metadata)
- Zookeeper Keeps the state of the cluster (brokers, topics, users).
- Topics are category/feed name to which records are stored and published
- Messages (Events) is unit of Data (Row, record, Map, Blob)
- Logs (Physical files) are used for storing data and managed by Broker. Logs are multiple files and pruned periodically
